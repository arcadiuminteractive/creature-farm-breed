Perfect! Let me fetch that repository and see what's currently in there.Excellent! I can see your repository is set up perfectly. There's a `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` file already created, along with the README. The repo is public, so I can access it.

Let me fetch the current content of the `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` file to see what you already have, then I'll provide you with the complete, updated version to replace it with.

Perfect! I can see your `GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md` file. It looks like it got cut off mid-sentence in the Farming System section (at "Players can actively ten"), but it's a great foundation.

Your structure is actually **better organized** than what I had started with earlier - I love the "Decision Log" and "Open Questions" sections! I'll integrate all the content we discussed, complete the sections, and keep your numbering/structure.

Here's the **complete, updated GAME_DESIGN_DOCUMENT.md** file. Copy this entire text and replace the content in your GitHub file:

## Creature Rarity System

### Rarity Tiers & Determination

| Rarity | How Obtained | Generation | Breeding Uses | Market Value |
|--------|--------------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Common** | Starter/captures | Gen 0 (Base) | 6 | Low (50-100 Gold) |
| **Uncommon** | Gen 1 hybrid | Gen 1 (Base + Base) | 5 | Medium (200-400 Gold) |
| **Rare** | Gen 2+ or perfect color | Gen 2+ (Hybrid + Hybrid) | 4 | High (500-1000 Gold) |
| **Epic** | Gen 3+ or stat-modified | Gen 3+ (Complex hybrids) | 4 | Very High (1500-3000 Gold) |
| **Legendary** | 4+ generations or Void Crystal | Gen 4+ with modifiers | 3 | Elite (5000-10000 Gold) |
| **Mythic** | 5+ generations, perfect stats | Gen 5+ perfection | 3 | God-tier (15000+ Gold) |

### Rarity Formula

```
Base Rarity = Generation Level (0-5+)
Color Rarity Multiplier:
  - Common colors: 1x
  - Rare colors: 2x  
  - Ultra-rare colors: 4x
  - Impossible colors: 8x

Stat Modifier Bonus:
  - +1 tier per applied modifier (Golden Dust, etc.)

Final Rarity = Base + (Color Multiplier × 0.5) + (Modifiers × 0.5)
```

**Example:** Gen 2 + Ultra-rare color (4x) + 1 modifier = Rare (2 + 2 + 0.5 = 4.5 → Rare)

### Inverted Breeding Limits Philosophy

**Commons breed more (6x), Rares breed less (3x):**
* Prevents infinite improvement spiral
* Commons maintain population, create resource economy
* Rares become precious, create prestige market
* Natural scarcity without artificial caps
* Encourages careful breeding strategy

# 5. BREEDING SYSTEM

## Breeding Requirements

### Creature Readiness
1. **All needs met:** Fed, happy (70%+), healthy
2. **Resources accumulated:** Species-specific (Fluffkin needs Cloud Fluff, etc.)
3. **Not on cooldown:** 24 hours between breedings per creature
4. **Breeding limit available:** 6→3 uses depending on rarity
5. **Stat thresholds:** Minimum 40/100 in relevant species stat

### Player Agreement
1. **Initiating player** sends breeding request
2. **Receiving player** can accept, counter-offer, or decline
3. **Payment negotiated:** Gold + resources (optional)
4. **Both confirm** → breeding proceeds

## Breeding Process Flow

```
1. Player A browses creatures (filter by species/rarity/stats/location)
2. Player A selects Player B's creature → "Breed Request"
3. Request details: "Breed my Fluffkin (Rare, 3/4 uses) with your Sparkwing for 500 Gold?"
4. Player B options:
   - ✅ Accept → Offspring to A, B gets payment
   - 💰 Counter → "800 Gold + 10 Essence Shards?"
   - ❌ Decline → No breeding
5. Agreement reached → Breeding starts (6-12 hour gestation)
6. Both creatures enter 24-hour cooldown
7. Offspring appears in Player A's inventory
8. Platform takes 5% fee → Treasury
9. Both creatures -1 breeding use
```

## Offspring Generation

### Genetic Inheritance
**Trait Distribution:**
* 50% chance inherit Parent A trait
* 50% chance inherit Parent B trait  
* 20% chance new blended trait (rare)
* Visual traits (colors, features) mix randomly

**Stat Inheritance (0-100 scale):**
```
Parent A: Stat = 75
Parent B: Stat = 60

Offspring possibilities:
- 40% inherit A: ~73 (75 ±2 variance)
- 40% inherit B: ~58 (60 ±2 variance)  
- 20% blend: ~67 (average ±5 variance)
```

**Generation Progression:**
* Gen 0 + Gen 0 = Gen 1 (Uncommon)
* Gen 1 + Gen 1 = Gen 2 (Rare)
* Gen 2+ + Gen 2+ = Gen 3+ (Epic/Legendary/Mythic)

### Color System
* **Primary Color:** 50% Parent A, 50% Parent B
* **Secondary Color:** 30% blend, 70% random from possible palette
* **Special Colors:** Ultra-rare rolls (1-5% chance for rainbows, metallics)
* **Impossible Colors:** Only from specific modifier combinations

## Breeding Economics

### Payment Structure
**Player-to-Player (No Platform Middleman):**
* Creates organic market discovery
* Compensates creature owner for rarity/use
* Negotiation adds social engagement
* Creates trading chains and relationships

**Typical Price Ranges:**
```
Common + Common: 50-150 Gold
Common + Rare: 200-500 Gold  
Rare + Rare: 400-800 Gold
Rare + Legendary: 800-1500 Gold
Legendary + Legendary: 1500-3000 Gold
```

**Platform Revenue:** 5% transaction fee
* Goes to Treasury (events, economy balancing)
* Legitimate monetization without pay-to-win
* Encourages high-volume breeding activity

### Breeding Limit Display
```
Creature: "Blossom" (Fluffkin, Rare)
Breeding Uses: 2/4 remaining
Cooldown: Ready in 3h 15m
Status: Happy (85%), Healthy

Visual: Green bar (full uses) → Yellow (half) → Red (1 left)
```

# 6. FARMING SYSTEM

## Farming Philosophy

**Dual Purpose:** Resource generation + creature engagement
**AFK-Friendly:** Base yields work completely passively
**Active Optional:** Small bonuses for engagement (no pressure)
**Specialization Focus:** Each creature type excels at specific resources

**Supported Playstyles:**
* Pure Farmer: 5 resource creatures, sell everything
* Pure Breeder: Buy/trade all resources, focus on genetics
* Hybrid: 2-3 farmers, 2-3 breeders
* Specialist: Focus on ultra-rare drops (Lumimoth gems)

## Farming Cycle

### Base Passive System (AFK-Friendly)
```
Creature plants resource node → 2-6 hour growth cycle
Harvest occurs automatically (even offline)
Resources added to storage
New cycle immediately restarts
Continues 24/7
```

**No Active Engagement Required:**
* Players can completely ignore farming
* Still generate enough for casual breeding
* ~50% of optimal yield
* Perfect for busy players

### Base Yields (No Bonuses)

| Creature | Primary Resource | Yield per Harvest | Cycle Time | Daily Max (Passive) |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Fluffkin** | Cloud Fluff | 10 | 2 hours | 120 |
| **Sparkwing** | Essence Shards | 5 | 4 hours | 30 |
| **Pebblehorn** | Stone Fragments | 15 | 1.5 hours | 240 |
| **Pebblehorn** | Hay Bundles | 10 | 2 hours | 120 |
| **Swirlpool** | Water Essence | 8 | 3 hours | 64 |
| **Lumimoth** | Gem Fragments | 3 | 6 hours | 12 |

### Active Engagement System (Optional)

**Stamina Pool:**
* Max: 100 points
* Regen: +10 per 10 minutes (full in ~1.5 hours)
* Login bonus: +25 stamina daily

**Active Activities:**

#### 1. Watering (Yield Boost)
* **Duration:** 30 seconds
* **Stamina:** 20
* **Effect:** +10% yield on next harvest
* **Max:** 3x per cycle
* **Best for:** Fluffkin, Swirlpool (water-sensitive)
* **Mini-game:** Tap falling water droplets (3/3 for bonus)

#### 2. Fertilizing (Rare Drop Boost)
* **Duration:** 1 minute  
* **Stamina:** 10
* **Resource Cost:** 1 Basic Resource (Hay, Water, etc.)
* **Effect:** +5% rare drop chance next harvest
* **Max:** 2x per cycle
* **Best for:** All creatures (universal benefit)

#### 3. Creature Interaction (Happiness Boost)
* **Duration:** 15 seconds
* **Stamina:** 5
* **Effect:** +5% happiness (affects breeding readiness)
* **Max:** Unlimited (diminishing returns)
* **Activities:** Pet, play, feed treats

**Active vs Passive Example:**
```
Pebblehorn Stone Farm (24 hours):
Passive: 15 Stone × 16 harvests = 240 Stone
Active (Water 3x, Fertilize 2x): 
  Yield: 15 × 1.30 = 19.5 Stone per harvest
  Rare chance: +10% Ironstone drops
  Total: ~312 Stone + 2-3 rare drops
```

## Resource Nodes & Storage

* **Monetization:** Robux Developer Products/Passes
* **Analytics:** Roblox Insights + custom tracking

### Key Technical Systems

#### 1. Creature Data Model
```lua
Creature = {
    id = "unique_uuid",
    species = "Fluffkin", -- Base type
    generation = 2, -- Breeding generation
    rarity = "Rare",
    breedingUses = { current = 3, max = 4 },
    stats = {
        cuteness = 78,
        health = 85,
        happiness = 92,
        energy = 65,
        speciesStat = 72 -- Comfort Expertise for Fluffkin
    },
    traits = {
        primaryColor = "soft_pink",
        secondaryColor = "white_spots",
        features = ["fluffy_tail", "big_eyes"],
        modifiers = ["golden_dust"] -- Applied stat boosts
    },
    breedingCooldown = timestamp, -- Last breeding time
    ownerId = "player_uuid",
    location = "habitat_slot_3"
}
```

#### 2. Resource System
* Persistent storage per player (DataStore)
* Real-time generation tracking
* Active/passive yield calculations
* Market price tracking (supply/demand)

#### 3. Breeding System

# 12. DECISION LOG

## Key Design Decisions

### Date: 2025-10-16

**1. Five Creature Limit**
* **Decision:** Maximum 5 creatures per player
* **Rationale:** Forces specialization, encourages social play, manageable scope
* **Alternatives Considered:** 3 (too restrictive), 8 (dilutes focus)
* **Impact:** Core to social dependency pillar

**2. Inverted Breeding Limits**
* **Decision:** Commons breed 6x, Mythics breed 3x
* **Rationale:** Creates natural scarcity, prevents infinite progression, economic balance
* **Alternatives Considered:** Flat limits (boring), unlimited (inflation)
* **Impact:** Foundation of breeding economy

**3. Player-to-Player Breeding Payments**
* **Decision:** Direct gold payments between players (5% platform cut)
* **Rationale:** Organic market discovery, social negotiation, sustainable revenue
* **Alternatives Considered:** Platform-only (disconnected), free breeding (no value)
* **Impact:** Creates trading relationships

**4. AFK-Friendly Farming**
* **Decision:** Passive base yields, optional active bonuses
* **Rationale:** Accessibility, broad appeal, fits chill vibe
* **Alternatives Considered:** Fully active (excludes casuals), no farming (too simple)
* **Impact:** Supports all playstyles

**5. Cosmetic-Only Monetization**
* **Decision:** No gameplay advantages for purchase
* **Rationale:** Fair play, community trust, long-term retention
* **Alternatives Considered:** Resource packs (pay-to-win), subscription (complex)
* **Impact:** Sustainable, ethical monetization

## Technical Decisions

**1. Roblox Platform**
* **Rationale:** Built-in social features, monetization, mobile support
* **Timeline:** Alpha in 3 months, Beta in 6 months

**2. Five Base Creatures**
* **Rationale:** Enough variety without overwhelming scope
* **Future:** DLC creatures planned for Year 2
